# Bootcamp Challenge 2 - Shawn Robinson 
 

## **Description**

For Challenge 2, the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria was provided: 

#### **User Story** 
- As an employer
- I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

#### **Acceptance Criteria** 
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

To accomplish this, I implemented: 
1. A media responsive site that utilizes media queries to adjust content size. 
2. A mobile-centric design, with a layout designed to look especially strong on mobile screen dimensions 
3. A multi-page portfolio site, with live links to individual pages for a more focused portfolio-viewing experience. 
4. A home page that utilizes pseudoclasses to reveal more content upon hovering over an individual card. 
5. A cool-colored, attractive color scheme that is universal throughout the site.
